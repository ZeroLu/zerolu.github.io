# Make programming less painful

I finally knows how to add libraries to python of C4D.
Simply use
```bash
pip install --target=C4DINSTALLLOCATION/resource/modules/python/Python.win64.framework/Lib/site-packages requests # numpy is an example of python library
```

And it works!!!!
But somehow Opencv and Numpy won't work, which is really weird.
