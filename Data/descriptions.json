Balavator tries to resolve this subtle emotional discomfort with games.Balavator is a balancing game. We utilize camera (background extraction and blob detection with Processing) to capture people's movement and simulate a seesaw style balancing box with Unity.User feedback plays a key role in iterations: We used low-fidelity prototype to test feedbacks and developed high-fidelity prototype based on that. Then we asked people who haven't tried the project to use it. To our surprise, many people failed to understand the game and distracted by some game elements. We made changes accordingly, which included increasing perspective, increasing shadows and improving robustness. The usability and user acceptance improved a lot.",
