# Introduction

MR (Mixed Reality) techonology is going to change the way we compute. It is very powerful but can be challenging to get right since there are a lot of unknowns.

[Ximmerse](https://www.ximmerse.com) specialized in MR technology as well as design research. We develop experiences for Rhino X in house and are constantly experimenting with new ways to use MR technology.

With years of research and development, we have condensed our learnings down into these design guidelines. We are also creating tools like *Mixed Reality Playground* and *MRITK(MR Interaction Toolkit)*, so that you can see these guidelines in action and actually use our code to build them. So stay tuned for more.

## Intro to MR Technology
There are a lot of buzzwords around technology. VR, AR, XR, Spatial Computing etc. 
Below is a short video explaining these buzzwords:

Our definition of MR is an optical-see-through stereo HMD(Head Mounted Display) with 6 DoF(Degree of Freedom) headtracking at least. Magic Leap One, HoloLens and Rhino X all fall into this category.
<!-- ### VR vs AR vs MR
The usage for VR (Virtual Reality) is quite narrow, it's a device that transports you into another virtual world, like Oculus Quest or HTC Vive. The term AR (Augmented Reality) is used more widely. It can be powered by a smart phone (Vuforia, Snapchat AR, or Lens Studio) or a head m
